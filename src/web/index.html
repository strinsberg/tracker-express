      <h1>Welcome to Issue Tracker Express</h1>
      <p>An issue tracking system is a list of issues,
or tickets, that can be dynamically modified, deleted and changed as needed by several different users.
Organizations employ issue tracking systems to simplify their workflow and prioritize which issues need to
be addressed first.
Issue tracking systems are essential for the smooth operation of many large projects. As problems arise
they can be added to an issue tracking system so that everyone is aware that there is a problem. This helps
to keep everyone informed about the state of the project and for critical needs to be addressed quickly.</p>
