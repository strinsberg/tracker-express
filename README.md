# Contributing

Master branch will always contain the current release. The only updates that will be made to this branch are merges with the dev branch or merges with bug fixes if they are urgent.

To add a feature or Bug fix in general create a new branch from the dev branch. Make your changes and then submit a pull request to the dev branch.
